NOTES:

index.html represents the home landing page. This page links to
three other webpages recipies.html, work.html, and dog.html through
the use of links that are activated by the use of a bootstrap asset
button group class containing buttons. index.html uses the grid layout
given by using bootstrap. There are 3 columns in use. 2 columns on
either end create the red border. All content is placed into the
center column.
    work.html contains a faux job history in a table using bootstrap's
table class. The table is located in the center column of the 3 column
layout I've used on the home page index.html.
    recipies.html utilizes an orderded list that contains ingredients
to make a dinner. This page makes used of scss inheritence by only
formating order lists that are the children of a div. It also
specially formats H2 that is the child of a div.
    The scss document allows the color of the borders to be changed
using the variable functionality. You will also see examples
of SCSS nesting and inheritance in this document. There is also
a mobile responsive @media query here that changes the color of the
center columns background based upon the width of the screen.
